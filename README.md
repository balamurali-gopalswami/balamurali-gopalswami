Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Balamurali Gopalswami

Iâ€™m interested in Software testing and development using Go, Python and anything challenging that you have. Have gained lots of experience through my professional life. I love programming from my childhood and I'm happy that I got a chance to study and work in a field which kept my wishes alive.

Other than that I love playing chess and lots of board games. In summer, cycling and tennis are my burn outs.
  
Iâ€™m currently learning advanced Go concepts, future events testing approaches, web3, blockchain, smart contracts and kubernetes.
  
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on blockchain technologies, future events testing frameworks, backward compatibility and lean reporting module.
