Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Balamurali Gopalswami

Iâ€™m interested in Software testing thorugh Automation. Have gained lots of experience through my professional life. I love programming from my childhood and I'm happy that I got a chance to study and work in a field which my kept my wishes alive.

Other than that I love playing Chess and lots of Board games. In summer, cycling and tennis are my burn outs.
  
Iâ€™m currently learning Advanced Go concepts, Future events testing approaches and Kubernetes.
  
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on future events testing frameworks, backward compatibility and lean reporting module.
